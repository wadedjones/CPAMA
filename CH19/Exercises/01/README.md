#### 1. A queue is similar to a stack, except that items are added at one end but removed from the other in a FIFO fashion. Operations on a queue might include:

> Inserting an item at the end of the queue  
> Removing an item from the beginning of the queue  
> Returning the first item in the queue (without changing the queue)  
> Returning the last item in the queue (without changing the queue)  
> Testing whether the queue is empty
