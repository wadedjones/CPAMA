#### Write a program that finds the roots of the equation `ax^2 + bx + c = 0` using the formula:

`x = (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)`

#### Have the program prompt for the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, then print both values of `x`. (if `b^2 - 4ac` is negative, the program should instead print a message to the effect that the roots are complex.)

#### Answer: see `root.c`.
