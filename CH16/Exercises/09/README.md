#### 9. Write the following functions. (The color structure is defined in Exercise 8.)

> (a) `struct color make_color(int red, int green, int blue);`  
> Returns a `color` structure containing the specified red, green, and blue values. If any argument is less than zero, the corresponding member of the structure will contain zero instead. If any arg is grater than 255, the corresponding member of the structure will contain 255.  

> (b) `int getRed(struct color c);`  
> Returns the value of c's red member.  

> (c) `bool equal_color(struct color color1, struct color color2);`  
> Returns `true` if the corresponding members of `color1` and `color2` are equal.  

> (d) `struct color brighter(struct color c);`  
> Returns a color structure that represents a brighter version of the color c. The structure is identical to c, except that each member has been divided by 0.7 (with the result truncated to an int). However, there are three special cases: (1) If all members of c are zero, the function returns a color whose members all have the value 3. (2) If any member of c is grater than 0 but less than 3, it is replaced by 3 before the division by 0.7. (3) If dividing by 0.7 causes a member to exceed 255, it is reduced to 255.  

> (e) `struct color darker(struct color c);`  
> Returns a color structure that represents a darker version of the color c. The structure is identical to c, except that each member has been multiplied by 0.7 (with the result truncated to an int).
