#### 16. Which of the following statements about enumeration constants are true?

> (a) An enumeration constant may represent any integer specified by the programmer.  
> (b) Enumeration constants have exactly the same properties as constants created using `#define`.  
> (c) Enumeration constants have the values 0, 1, 2, ... by default.  
> (d) All constants in an enumeration must have different values.

#### Answer:

> (a) True.  
> (b) False. Enumerations fall under C's scope rules.  
> (c) True.  
> (d) False. The names have to be different, but the programmer can assign the same value to multiple members.  
> (e) True.
