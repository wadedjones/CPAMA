#### 7. Assume that the `fraction` structure contains two members: `numerator` and `denominator` (both of type `int`). Write functions that perform the following operations on fractions:

> (a) Reduce the fraction `f` to lowest terms.  
> (b) Add the fractions `f1` and `f2`.  
> (c) Subtract the fraction `f2` from `f1`.  
> (d) Multiply the fractions `f1` and `f2`.  
> (e) Divid the fraction `f1` by `f2`.  

#### The fractions `f`, `f1`, and `f2` will be arguments of type `struct fraction`; each function will return a value of type `struct fraction`. The fractions returned by the functions in parts (b)-(e) should be reduced to lowest terms.
