#### 1. Rewrite the `max_int` function so that, instead of passing the number of integers as the first argument, we must supply 0 as the last argument. Hint: `max_int` must have at least one "normal" parameter, so you can't remove the paramter `n`. Instead, assume that it represents one of the numbers to be compared.

#### Answer: see `max_int.c`.
