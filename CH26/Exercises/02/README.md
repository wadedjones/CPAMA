#### Write a simplified version of `printf` in which the only conversion specification is `%d`, and all arguments after the first are assumed to have `int` type. If the function encounters a `%` character that's not immediately followed by a `d` character, it should ignore both characters. The function should use calls of `putchar` to produce all output. You may assume that the format string doesn't contain escape sequences.
