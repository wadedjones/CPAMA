#### 1. Extend the `canopen.c` program of Section 22.2 so that the user may put any number of file names on the command line:

`canopen foo bar baz`

#### The program should print a separate `can be opened` or `can't be opened` message for each file. Have the program terminate with the status `EXIT_FAILURE` if one ore more of the files can't be opened.

#### Answer: see `canopen.c`.
