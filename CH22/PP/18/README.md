#### 18. Write a program that reads integers from a text file whose name is given as a command-line argument. Each line of the file may contain any number of integers (including none) separated by one or more spaces. Have the program display the largest number in the file, the smallest number, and the median (the number closest to the middle if the integers were sorted). If the file contains an even number of integers, there will be two numbers in the middle; the program should display their average (rounded down). You may assume that the file contains no more than 10,000 integers. hint: store the integers in an array and then sort the array.
