#### 2. (C99) Write the parameterized macros `INT32_C(n)`, `UINT32_C(n)`, `INT64_C(n)`, and `UINT64_C(n)`, assuming that the `int` type and `long int` types are 32 bits wide and the `long long int` type is 64 bits wide. Hint: Use the `##` preprocessor operator to attach a suffix to `n` containing a combination of `L` and/or `U` characters.

#### Answer:

```c
#define INT32_C(n)
#define UINT32_C(n)
#define INT64_C(n)
#define UINT64_C(n)
```
